# What is this project?

This project is just for learning purposes related to OAuth2, 
is a fork from https://github.com/wagnerdelima/facebook_setup

The objective of this is to create a OAuth2 provider that can be consume by external clients (other servers, SPA webs, server side webs)

To learn more about OAuth topic check the following resources:
https://www.oauth.com/
https://docs.authlib.org/en/latest/oauth/index.html

For OAuth to work, this project is making use of the following libraries 

drf-social-oauth2 -> django-oauth-toolkit
                  -> python-social-auth


# How does it work?

In this case I wanted to simulate that the OAuth2 provider will be used by a SPA web

As the SPA web is a public client (we cannot trust to have or share secrets with this side) we need to
use the authentication-code grant type (ref: https://docs.authlib.org/en/latest/specs/rfc6749.html#authlib.oauth2.rfc6749.grants.AuthorizationCodeGrant)

First of all we need to create a OAuth Client (In django-oauth-toolkit is call Application) in the django admin panel, add this in redirect_urls (substitue domain for your domain in use):

https://robertofd1995-facebook-setup-695r7v67cr7pp-8000.githubpreview.dev/noexist/callback


It will be used later on in the example, set it as public and authenticated_code as type, copy and paste  clietn_id and client_secrets, then Check OAuth2.http to see how it continues


After checking and undertanding how OAuth2.http you can continue with oauth2-social.http to check how can you login with google and exchange it's token with your application access token


#Â TODOS

1 ) Social login with Google

2) Ask user only once the credentials
See: https://django-oauth-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced_topics.html#skip-authorization-form

I should use approval_prompt with auto

3) Improve security by PKCE
